notes on tone:
see: https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/effective-writing-13815989

shorter = better
no filler words,
active voice (we made a mistake vs a mistake was made by us)
verb tenses:
    -past: work done, work reported, observations
    -present: general truths like conclusions and atemporal facts (what does paper cover)
    -future: perspective, only things that will happen in the future
