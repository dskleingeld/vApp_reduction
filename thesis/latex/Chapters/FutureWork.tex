There are a number of ways to improve the results. We advise to look into \ac{RDI} instead of \ac{ADI}. \ac{RDI} will have far less self subtraction then \ac{ADI}. Another approach would be fitting a large collection of disk models to the observed image. We expect this will give better results then \ac{ADI}.

The \ac{ADI} routine might be improved using only a few images as close in time as possible as reference sequence \cite{Marois_2006}. This should reject more seeing, however if done improperly this can increase self subtraction. This improvement would make the largest difference close to the star where \ac{ADI} currently is promising.

As the disks are heavily deformed after \ac{ADI} trying to fit the result \ac{ADI} result to \textit{starless} disk models with \ac{ADI} applied could help find the parameters of the disk. This could even be extended to training a neural network to generate a disk model given an output of \ac{ADI}.
